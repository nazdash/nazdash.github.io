Imagine the world where people don't lie and cheat. 

The world where people need less negotiation, less lawyers, less compliance procedures, less audits, less bureaucracy. The world where all these freed-up resources can be used to improve productivity.

This is exactly what crypto brings to the world - **a system where people can be excluded out of the decision making processes and replaced by trustless open sourced apps, which don't lie and cheat**.
