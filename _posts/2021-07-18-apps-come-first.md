A breakthrough app which is built for the first time on top of old infrastructure driving the market to create new infrastructure to make it possible to run better and scale faster this new kind of the app.

After, this new level infrastructure gives the ability to create new early-stage breakthrough apps, which again drives infrastructure to grow to the next level.

It's happening again and again within the different industries. And it's better to know at which stage your industry is right now.

I believe, a couple of industries I'm interested in, like logistics, robotics and space are right now at the end of the latest infrastructure-grow cycle and within the next 10 years we mainly should see new breakthrough applications to appear within them.
