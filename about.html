  <p>Hi, my name is Nazir.</p>
  <p>I studied <strong>math & physics</strong> at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.</p>
  <p>While pursuing my master's degree I've worked in chemical physics and mass spectrometry.</p>
  <p>In 2012 I joined a startup and moved to <strong>data science</strong> field.</p>
  <p>Since 2016 at first as a part of Uber Russia team and later as a part of Yandex I was building russian <strong>ride-hailing</strong> and <strong>food delivery</strong> markets.</p>
  <p>In 2022 I moved to Netherlands where I'm building now a new company - staffing marketplace in a healthcare.</p>
  <p>I love to <strong>build things</strong> and occasionally start different projects.</p>
  <p>I genuinely interested in <strong>machine learning, marketplaces, blockchain, robotics and space exploration</strong>.</p>
