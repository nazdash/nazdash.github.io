  <p>Hi, my name is Nazir.</p>
  <p>I studied <strong>math & physics</strong> at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.</p>
  <p>While pursuing my master's degree I've worked in chemical physics and mass spectrometry.</p>
  <p>In 2012 I left my job at lab and joined a small startup as a <strong>data scientist</strong>.</p>
  <p>Since 2016 at first as a part of Uber Russia team and later as a part of Yandex I'm building russian <strong>ride-hailing</strong> and <strong>food delivery</strong> markets.</p>
  <p>I love to <strong>build things</strong> and occasionally starting a startups.</p>
  <p>I genuinely interested in <strong>machine learning, logistics, blockchain, robotics and space exploration</strong>.</p>
